# Stacky
Stacky is an esoteric proggraming language
This language is written in lua, so to use this language first install lua.
If you have done that install the stacky.lua file and run it
Now you will see you have to enter the .stacky file.
So make a file in the directory you are in (for exapmle: main.stacky)
Then enter the name of the file (so main.stacky in this example)
And run the code!
Of course now you dont know hot to use this language...
But you will know if you read just a bit more
:D
