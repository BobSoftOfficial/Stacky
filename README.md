# Stacky
Stacky is an esoteric proggraming language
This language is written in lua, so to use this language first install lua.
If you have done that install the stacky.lua file and run it
Now you will see you have to enter the .stacky file.
So make a file in the directory you are in (for exapmle: main.stacky)
Then enter the name of the file (so main.stacky in this example)
And run the code!
Of course now you dont know hot to use this language...
But you will know if you read just a bit more
:D


## tutoriol

EVERY command in stacky NEEDS to be on a new line

0-26: Prints the ASCII character corresponding to the number where 1 = 'a', 26 = 'z'.

')' : Prints a newline (starts a new line).

'(' : Prints a space character.

'+' : Skips the execution of the next line.

'-' : Jumps back to the previous line.

'=' : Resets the program to the first line (start over).

'.' : Replaces the next line with the first line of the program.

'/' : Changes the next line to be the division of the previous line by itself (result is 1).

'*' : Changes the next line to be the multiplication of the previous line by itself (squares the number).

'^' : Sets the line two lines after this to be the same as the next line.

'!' : Jumps to the value of 2 lines ahead of it if the line behind it is the same is the line in front of it

',' : Makes an input, and whatever you input will be the value of the next line
