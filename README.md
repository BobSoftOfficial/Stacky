# Stacky
Stacky is an esoteric proggraming language
This language is written in lua, so to use this language first install lua.
If you have done that install the stacky.lua file and run it
Now you will see you have to enter the .stacky file.
So make a file in the directory you are in (for exapmle: main.stacky)
Then enter the name of the file (so main.stacky in this example)
And run the code!
Of course now you dont know hot to use this language...
But you will know if you read just a bit more
:D


## tutoriol

EVERY command in stacky NEEDS to be on a new line

Numbers from 0 to 26 will print the ASCII character: 1 = 'a', 26 = 'z'.

) outputs a new line (newline).

( outputs a space.

+ skips the next line.

- goes back to the previous line (jumps one line down).

= resets the program to the first line.

. changes the next line to be the same as the first line.

/ changes the next line to the division of the previous line by itself.

* changes the next line to the multiplication of the previous line by itself.

^ changes the line two lines ahead to the value of the next line.
